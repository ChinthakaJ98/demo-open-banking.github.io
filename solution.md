## Overview

WSO2 Open Banking combines the technical capabilities of WSO2 API Manager, WSO2 Identity Server, WSO2 Stream Processor, and WSO2 Enterprise Integrator and supports the technology stack that banks need to become PSD2 and CDR compliant and digitally transformed. 

WSO2 Open Banking leverages five key technology areas critical to a banking infrastructure; API Management, Identity and Access Management, Integration, Analytics and Business Insights, and Fraud Detection bundled together to form a componentized architecture. This gives the flexibility to reuse existing infrastructure, and banks only need to obtain the components that are not available in their current infrastructure.
