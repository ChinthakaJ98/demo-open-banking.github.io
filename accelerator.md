## Overview

WSO2 Open Banking Accelerator is a collection of technologies that increases the speed and reduces the complexity of
adopting open banking compliance. Instead of building a solution from scratch, you can use WSO2 Open Banking
Accelerator to meet all legislative requirements with additional benefits beyond compliance. The accelerator runs on top
of WSO2 Identity Server and WSO2 API Manager.

The accelerator mainly addresses the open banking requirements such as API consumer application onboarding, consent
management, and access authorization among numerous other 
[features](https://ob.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/learn/consent-management/) to set up an open
banking solution. You can easily [implement a toolkit](https://ob.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/develop/develop-toolkit/) 
to customize the accelerator and help you comply with any regional open banking standard.
